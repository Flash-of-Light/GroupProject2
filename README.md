# Dash What?

DashBored is meant to be a simple home page replacement to give users unique tools and/or information over the traditional search engine default. In the initial version, the example widget-style tools are fixed. Future versions will work towards giving users a customizable experience, by allowing them to pick and choose which tools they want visible, as well as color schemes, and other potential aesthetics. 

Initial deployment included:
* Local Weather Forecasts
* A Movie Showtime Viewer 
* To-do List
* Holiday Calendar
* Magic 8-Ball 

Currently layout and styling utilizes bootstrap 4, but future iterations will explore flexbox as a new design option.

## Initial Troubles

The idea of a modualar, widget-style design was a central focus for us as a group. However this posed some problems as we were developing our application design. Being new to both Express.js and MVC, and attempting to work on these pieces individually, intense communication was needed to properly execute the idea. As such, we are currently working to properly build and view our database connections for the needed applications (e.g. to-do list).
